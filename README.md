This repository is deprecated; it is no longer used in the build process for
[smartos-live](http://github.com/joyent/smartos-live) or any other SDC
component.  The repository remains on github so that change history for files
that were originally hosted here is preserved.

This repository was part of the Joyent SmartDataCenter project (SDC).  For
contribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.
